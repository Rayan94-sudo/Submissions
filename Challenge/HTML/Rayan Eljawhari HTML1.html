    <h2>Elements of painting</h2>

    <h3>Color and tone</h3>
    <p>
      <q>Color,</q>made up of hue, saturation, and value, dispersed over a
      surface is the essence of <i>painting</i>, just as pitch and rhythm are
      the essence of music. Color is highly subjective, but has observable
      psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the
      next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but in the East,
      white is. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including
      Goethe,[3] Kandinsky,[4] and Newton,[5] have written their own color
      theory.
      <br />
      Moreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a color
      equivalent. The word "red", for example, can cover a wide range of
      variations from the pure red of the visible spectrum of light. There is
      not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is
      agreement on different notes in music, such as F or Câ™¯. For a<strong>
        painter</strong
      >, color is not simply divided into basic (primary) and derived
      (complementary or mixed) <em>colors</em> (like red, blue, green, brown,
      etc.).
